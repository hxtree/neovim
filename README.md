# hxtree/neovim setup

## Installation

On MacOS, the default terminal emulator is not compatible with neovim.
To use Neovim, you can install [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/), a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator.

For Neovim installation instructions, see the [neovim installation guide](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

Note packer install plugins to the following directory:

```sh
~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start
```
